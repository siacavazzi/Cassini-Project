# Cassini Project
 ## Overview

The Cassini project is my attempt at processing the data from NASA's Cassini mission into color images and videos. You can learn more about the Cassini mission [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens). The TL;DR is that Cassini was a probe sent to explore Saturn and its moons. Over the course of the mission it took over 450,000 black and white images. These images are available to the public on [NASA's PDS website](https://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search/?fq=-ATLAS_THUMBNAIL_URL%3Abrwsnotavail.jpg&fq=ATLAS_MISSION_NAME%3Acassini&q=*%3A*).
